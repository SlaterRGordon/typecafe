# Phase 3 — Progression

**Goal:** a four-week user can produce the chart that proves they got faster — and wants to post it.

Bests plateau in weeks; trends compound forever. This phase builds the user's real home.

---

## 3.1 `/progress` — the home for signed-in users (L)

The page answers one question — *am I getting faster?* — before any other detail.

**Layout, top to bottom:**
1. **Headline delta:** "+9.4 WPM in 30 days" (largest number on the page; period switcher 7/30/90/all). If flat or negative: honest, with the Phase 4 hook — "Plateaued for 3 weeks — your drills aren't targeting your slow keys."
2. **WPM trend chart** — per-test scatter + rolling average line, filterable by mode/length (reuse the score-card chart component, extended)
3. **Accuracy + consistency trends** — same x-axis, small multiples
4. **Lifetime keyboard heatmap** — `<KeyHeatmap full>` over `KeyStat` aggregates, with a date-range comparison toggle ("30 days ago vs now") to show keys warming from red to green
5. **Worst-transitions list** — top 5 slow bigrams, each ending in **[Drill]** (the everywhere-rule)
6. **Records timeline** — PBs as dated events: "Mar 3 — first 80+ WPM test"

**Data:** trends read the `Test` table (signed-in) or the localStorage mirror (guests — local-first means guests get a real `/progress` from day one, capped at their stored history; the page itself is the signup pitch: "sign in to keep this forever").

**Aggregation:** a `DailyUserStat` rollup table (userId, date, tests, bestWpm, avgWpm, avgAcc) maintained on test-save (derived-on-write, no cron) keeps chart queries O(days) not O(tests).

## 3.2 Streaks (S)

- Practice-day streak computed from `DailyUserStat` on read — no jobs
- Shown on `/progress`, profile, and the share card ("12-day streak" chip)
- A streak counts any completed test or drill ≥ 30s of typing — streaks reward *practice*, not test-spam (vision: no decorative gamification; streaks and deltas only)

## 3.3 Delta-first sharing (M)

The share available to *every* user, not just fast ones:

- **Progress card:** "+18 WPM in 60 days" + the trend chart, generated through the existing share pipeline (slug page, fixed-size PNG, OG image) — a second `ScoreShare` kind: `kind: "progress"` with its own snapshot zod schema
- Score-card share gains a delta line when history exists: "3 WPM over my 30-day average"
- OG image for progress shares leads with the delta, not the absolute

## 3.4 Weekly recap — in-app, free-tier honest (M)

No email provider exists. The recap is a surface, not a send:

- On first visit ≥ 7 days after the last recap, `/progress` opens with a recap state: the week's delta, keystrokes, streak, one prescribed focus ("your `b` cost you the most this week → [Drill]")
- Recap is itself shareable (same progress-card pipeline)
- **When there's budget:** the same payload becomes an email via Resend/Postmark — the recap generator (`src/lib/recap.ts`) is written render-agnostic from day one

## 3.5 Goals (M)

- One active goal: target WPM + date ("100 by September")
- `/progress` shows trajectory: current rolling average projected linearly vs required pace — honest about shortfall ("at this pace you reach 100 in November; to hit September, X sessions/week")
- Projection math in `src/lib/trajectory.ts`, unit-tested, assumptions documented on `/how-we-measure`
- No notifications (no infra) — the goal lives where the user already looks

## 3.6 Consistency everywhere (S)

`consistencyFromSamples` exists; surface it: score card (with `?` → `/how-we-measure`), `/progress` trend, diagnosis input in Phase 4 ("your speed is fine; your variance is the problem").

## Sequencing note

3.1 before everything (it's the destination other features link to). Then 3.3 (sharing compounds earliest), 3.2, 3.4, 3.5/3.6.

## Acceptance

- [ ] A user with 4 weeks of history sees their delta in < 3 seconds on `/progress`
- [ ] A *guest* with 2 weeks of local history sees the same page, plus the keep-it-forever signup pitch
- [ ] Progress share card unfurls correctly on Discord/Twitter (OG verified like the score card was)
- [ ] Streak math correct across timezones (test: tests at 23:50 and 00:10)
- [ ] Every trend chart renders sanely with 1 data point, 10, and 1,000
- [ ] Screenshot tour: /progress (rich history, sparse history, guest, recap state, goal on/off track)

**Owner's part:** seed real usage (your own daily tests make the first real trend), judge whether the headline delta *feels* motivating, share the first progress card publicly.
